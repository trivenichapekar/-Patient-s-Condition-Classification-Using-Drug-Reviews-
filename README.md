# -Patient-s-Condition-Classification-Using-Drug-Reviews-
# Bussiness Objective :
This is a sample dataset which consists of 161297 drug name, condition reviews and ratings from different patients and our goal is to examine how
patients are feeling using the drugs their positive and negative experiences so that we can recommend him a suitable drug. By analyzing the
reviews, we can understand the drug effectiveness and its side effects
#  DataSet Details :
The dataset provides patient reviews on specific drugs along with related conditions and a 10
star patient rating reflecting overall patient satisfaction.
So in this dataset, we can see many patients conditions but we will focus only on the below,
classify the below conditions from the patients reviews
a. Depression
c. High Blood Pressure
d. Diabetes, Type 2
# Libraries

# Future Work :
# 1.Contextual and Temporal Analysis
Temporal Analysis: Analyzing the progression of patient reviews over time can help identify changes in drug effectiveness or emerging side effects, providing insights into long-term treatment outcomes.
Longitudinal Studies: By studying patient reviews over longer periods, we can gain a better understanding of the conditions and the effectiveness of drug treatments over time.
# 2. Enhanced Machine Learning Models
Transformer-Based Models: Employing advanced models like BERT, GPT-4, or T5 could significantly improve the understanding of drug review texts.
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs): Constructing a knowledge graph of drugs, conditions, and patient experiences using GNNs may provide a deeper understanding of relationships and improve classification accuracy.
Ensemble Learning: Using an ensemble of models (e.g., combining traditional machine learning models like SVM with deep learning models like LSTM or CNN) to improve prediction accuracy.
# 3. Personalized Recommendations and Predictive Analytics
Personalized Drug Effectiveness Predictions: Using patient-specific features to predict which drugs might be most effective for a given condition based on similar patient reviews.
Predictive Analytics for Adverse Events: Developing models to predict potential adverse drug reactions based on historical reviews and patient conditions.
# 4.Exploring Causal Inference
Causal Analysis: Investigating causal relationships between drug use and patient-reported outcomes to understand the underlying factors affecting patient conditions, beyond mere correlations found in the data.
